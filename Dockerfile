# Readiness, not liveness.
#
# Docker's HEALTHCHECK is what `depends_on: condition: service_healthy` waits on and what an
# orchestrator uses to take a container out of rotation, so the useful question is "can this instance
# serve a request?" rather than "is the process alive?". `/ready` proves the database answers and the
# Master identity is pinned; `/health` would answer 200 for a process that could do neither.
#
# `--start-period` covers migrations and the master pin on first boot, which run before the listener
# binds — during that window a probe failure is expected and must not count against the container.
